p2m cluster mode should work same as "basic" node clustering code
just execute code in pm2 cluster mode.

test out if can generate and read in the same code pm2 logs
so, pm2 start server, -> pm2 generates log file for the session -> after while in code, read the log file generated
(could be something like, code reads all files in designated folder).

Need to make websockets for servers, servers send out data and comannds to eachother
For example have "main" server and discord bot server running on same pm2, -> if discord bot gets some command, 
process the command and send needed information through websocket to "main" server.

"Main" server could have running frontend website, with command input "form" available
Need to create seperate api that "main" server uses, and use React with ajax framework to inject and update the html page with new data
